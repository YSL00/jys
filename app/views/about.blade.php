		<p>Hi! I'm Jacky. I graduated from the Computer Systems Technology program at BCIT.</p>
		<p>I know Java, C, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, PHP, and SQL. </p>

			I made this simple site using Laravel, a PHP framework, and Bootstrap CSS and JQuery. 
			This site is still under development and if you have ideas about what I can add to it,
